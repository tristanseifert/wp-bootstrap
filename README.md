wp-bootstrap
============

A simple Wordpress theme based on Twitter Bootstrap, intended to be used as a sort of blank canvas for customisation. Combined with the power of Bootstrap and a clean, empty codebase, this theme is the ideal base for anyone needing a starting point for a theme.

Plus it already has support for custom code to add in the header and footer text, as well as displaying page execution times. Woo.
